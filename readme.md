# Gemini CLI Clone


A simple CLI clone of the Gemini API that I have built to learn more about CLI development using Go.

> This is my Golang learning project - I'm teaching myself Go by building something useful! I wrote all the code myself (no AI code generation), just used Claude to help me understand Go concepts, generate a roadmap, and find the right documentation when I got stuck.
